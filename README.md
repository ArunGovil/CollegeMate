# CollegeMate
CollegeMate is a minimal yet modern mobile application that aims to normalize dating and make it accessible for every student. While the word Dating might feel a bit intolerable for many, in reality, it simply isnâ€™t. Indeed the lack of awareness on topics like these has seriously affected many of us in a variety of ways.

With CollegeMate, students will be able to explore a whole new world that is specifically built for meeting new people and making friends, based on their preferences. On the platform, students can create personal profiles, look for dates, and communicate mutually using private chats.

The app ought to be built specifically for college students, making clear progress over any existing systems. Even though dating apps like Tinder, OkCupid, etc are available on the internet, the lack of awareness and incompetence to change keeps most people away from using them. As a consequence, introducing an app like CollegeMate is a pressing priority.

Cheers!
